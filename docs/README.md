# PhilaIndiaCovers — Documentation Index

Start here. This tells you which document to open based on what you're actually trying to do — not a list to read top to bottom.

## "I want the full picture, business and technical"
→ **`PRD-v1.0.md`** — the main Product Requirements Document. Problem, goals, requirements, scope, everything. Start here if you're new to the project entirely.

## "I want to understand how the system is architected, visually"
→ **`High-Level-Design.md`** — context diagram, container diagram, entity relationships, the verification-status state machine, the security trust-boundary diagram, key sequence flows. Best for a technical walkthrough or architecture review conversation.

## "Why did we choose Electron / Supabase / two repos / Microsoft Store / this specific security pattern?"
→ **`Architecture-Decision-Records.md`** — six short records (Context → Decision → Consequences) covering every major technical call, with the tradeoffs we knowingly accepted written down, not just the decision itself.

## "I'm about to actually build something — what's the detailed design?"
→ **`Low-Level-Design.md`** — deliberately scoped to only what's currently being built (the Walking Skeleton, T-01–T-09), extended task-by-task as work progresses. Don't expect this to cover stories that haven't started yet — that's intentional, not a gap.

## "Is this secure? What have we thought about?"
→ **`Threat-Model.md`** — a lightweight STRIDE-based review, scoped honestly to a ~100-user niche app rather than enterprise paranoia. Kept current as mitigations actually ship (e.g. CSV-injection moved from "open" to "resolved" once T-02 shipped it).

## "How do we know this actually works, and stays working?"
→ **`Test-Strategy.md`** — the testing pyramid (unit/integration/E2E), what's automated today vs. still manual, and the CI gate plan.

## "What exactly does the database look like?"
→ **`API-Integration-Contracts.md`** — full column-level schema, RLS policy design, and the custom functions (like `verify_cover()`) that enforce the security model.

## "What's the actual backlog, and why is it organized this way?"
→ **`Epics-UserStoryMap.md`** — all 11 Epics and 42 User Stories, built with Jeff Patton's Story Mapping method, plus the release-slicing logic (Walking Skeleton first, then the rest).

## "I'm Claude Code, starting a session — what do I need to know?"
→ **`AI-Agent-Implementation-Brief.md`** for repo conventions and task-decomposition method, plus **`ClaudeCode-Continuity-Playbook.md`** for the `/standup` and `/wrapup` system that keeps sessions honest across time.

## "What's the official list of India Post postal circles?"
→ **`Postal-Circles-Reference.md`** — the 23 official circles, verified against India Post's own site, with the two naming quirks ("Orissa," "North Eastern") called out explicitly so they don't get "corrected" by mistake.

## "I'm evaluating this as a potential investor or supporter"
→ **`Investor-PRFAQ.md`** — an honest press-release-and-FAQ format (Amazon's "Working Backwards" method), including the real, hard questions (what has to be true, top reasons this might not work) — written to inform a real decision, not to sell.

## "I'm a collector, just tell me what this app does"
→ **`About-EndUsers.md`** — plain-language, no architecture, no jargon. This is the only document in the set meant for the actual end-user audience.

## "I'm new to some of these engineering concepts — is that OK?"
Yes — look for **📚 Learning Note** callouts throughout the HLD, ADRs, and Threat Model. They explain real, named industry concepts (the C4 model, trust boundaries, state machines, `SECURITY DEFINER` functions, STRIDE) inline, right where they're used, rather than assuming prior knowledge. Skip them if you already know the concept — they're written to be easy to skip, not mandatory reading.

## A Note on Keeping This Set Honest

Several of these documents (particularly the LLD and Threat Model) describe things that change as real code gets built — they are living documents tied to actual implementation state, not one-time artifacts written once and frozen. When a task moves from "planned" to "built," the relevant document should be updated to match reality, not left describing a plan that's since diverged from what actually shipped. This index itself should be the first stop for figuring out what needs updating when that happens — if you're not sure which document a change belongs in, it's listed above.
